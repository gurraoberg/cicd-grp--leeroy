# Note: secret.key is purposefully not tracked by git. This should be backed up
# separately because configs may contain secrets which were encrypted using the
# secret.key.  To back up secrets use 'tar -czf /tmp/secrets.tgz secret*' and
# save the file separate from your repository.  If you want secrets backed up
# with configuration, then see the bottom of this file for an example.

# Ignore all JENKINS_HOME except jobs directory, root xml config, and
# .gitignore file.
/*
!/jobs
!/.gitignore
!/*.xml

# Ignore all files in jobs subdirectories except for folders.
# Note: git doesn't track folders, only file content.

!jobs/**/

# Uncomment the following line to save next build numbers with config.

#!jobs/**/nextBuildNumber

# For performance reasons, we want to ignore builds in Jenkins jobs because it
# contains many tiny files on large installations.  This can impact git
# performance when running even basic commands like 'git status'.

# Exclude only config.xml files in repository subdirectories.
!config.xml

# Don't track workspaces (when users build on the master).
jobs/**/*workspace

# Security warning: If secrets are included with your configuration, then an
# adversary will be able to decrypt all encrypted secrets within Jenkins
# config.  Including secrets is a bad practice, but the example is included in
# case someone still wants it for convenience.  Uncomment the following line to
# include secrets for decryption with repository configuration in Git.

#!/secret*

# As a result, only Jenkins settings and job config.xml files in JENKINS_HOME
# will be tracked by git.

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
